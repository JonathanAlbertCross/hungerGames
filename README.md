What do I consider bad design?

I find that deliberately incorporating the characteristics of "bad design" in web development can be an intentional design strategy, often referred to as "anti-design" or "brutalism." This approach involves embracing unconventional and intentionally flawed design elements to create a distinctive and often captivating user experience, breaking away from established design norms. It is typically used for artistic expression or to convey a specific message, but it may not be suitable for all websites and might deviate from what users normally expect. The key is to strike a balance between creativity and usability, ensuring that it fulfills its intended purpose without causing user frustration.

On this website, I explore the concept of "anti-design" or "brutalism" in a fun, interactive, and thought-provoking way.
